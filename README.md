# ðŸŒ€ Automated Serverless RDS Cluster Provisioning

##  Overview

This project provides a fully automated, serverless solution for provisioning **RDS PostgreSQL/MySQL clusters** on AWS based on developer requests. It leverages API Gateway, SNS, SQS, Lambda, SSM, ASM, GitHub, Terraform, and CircleCI to enable a scalable and secure workflow.

**Key Features:**
- Developers send a JSON request (via API Gateway)
- Request is routed through SNS â†’ SQS â†’ Lambda
- Lambda creates a GitHub Pull Request with Terraform code
- CI/CD pipeline applies the infrastructure using Terraform
- Supports both **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**, in **dev** and **prod** environments

##  Instructions

1. Fork this repository and keep the name: serverless_rds_cluster_automation
2. In your AWS account, create a new Secret in ASM:
    Name: github-lambda-token
    key: token
    value: your github token value
2. Log in to CircleCI using GitHub Auth here: https://circleci.com/vcs-authorize
3. Set up a Project by selecting the repo, Branch = main
4. In Project Settings, set up 2 GitHub Triggers: Push to default branch, PR merged
4. Define Environment Variables:
   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-secret-access-key
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   - AWS_REGION=any-region-1
   - DB_USERNAME=db-username-you-want
   - DB_PASSWORD=db-password-you-want
5. Run the pipeline. Only for the first time, it will run bootstrap.py to set everything. then it will create the SAM stack.
6. That's it! your SAM stack is now expecting JSONs from the API Gateway's /request Invoke URL.
    JSON Example:
    curl -X POST https://YOUR_URL.execute-api.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com/provision/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "db_name": "testdb123",
    "env": "prod",
    "engine": "postgres"
  }'
